            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think, learn, and problem-solve like humans. AI systems utilize algorithms and vast data sets to perform tasks such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and predicting outcomes. Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves training systems on data to improve over time without explicit programming. AI has applications in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and transportation, enhancing efficiency and innovation. Despite its potential, AI raises ethical concerns, such as privacy, bias, and the impact on employment. Ensuring responsible development and use of AI is crucial.
